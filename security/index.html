	<h1> Homework #4 - Security Assessment of Mapchat </h1>
	Jade Chan

	<h2> Introduction </h2>
	This assessment tests the security of Mapchat, developed by Deanna Bessy. This includes both the client-side (assignment 2), and the server-side (homework 3) developed by Deanna Bessy. 

	According to the specifications	she followed from her client, the client-side of MapChat must send her current location and other information to a datastore. It must also then retrieve and display all of the information recieved. 

	The server side has three requirements. Firstly, it must fulfill a POST request: when an approved check-in request is submitted, the server will return a JSON string with all of the stored data. Secondly, the server must fulfill a GET request that parses a query and returns the last known location of a login as a JSON string. And lastly, the MapChat server must display a list of information for all the logins. 

	This document will identify the vulnerabilities in the server. 
	
	<h2> Methodology </h2>
	Describe your methodology pen testing the application, including the tools that you used

	<h2> Abstract of Findings </h2>
	Provide an overview of all the security and privacy issues you identified. This section should be written for non-technical managers who do not have technical expertise and do not have time to read the entire document. Write this section using lay language

	<h2> Issues Found </h2>

	<p> 1. Script injection (Back-end) </p>
	<ul>
		<li> Through injection, I was able to insert malicious code into the webpage. This was done through the POST request, in /sendLocation. I sent several harmful lines of code through the message field by wrapping it inside of a < script > tag. 
		</li>
		<li> Inserting an image into the list </li>
		<li> Alerting the user </li>
		<li> Redirecting the page </li>
		<li> Severity of the issue: HIGH. This is an extremely dangerous vulnerability, since hackers are basically capable of injecting any code into server,  </li>
		<li> Resolution: Test the message string for </li>
	</ul>

	2. Style injection (Front-end)

	3. Flooding server


	4. General authentication


	For each issue that you find, document:
	Issue (e.g., database injection, really bad programming practice)
	Location / page where issue was found
	Severity of issue (e.g., low, medium , or high). Justify your answer.
	Description of issue. How did you find it? A screenshot of problem is excellent.
	Proof of vulnerability. Screenshots are ideal.
	Resolution. How did you resolve the issue? Show code if possible.


	<h2> Conclusion </h2>
	Conclusion - You can also list future considerations and recommendations with costs.
