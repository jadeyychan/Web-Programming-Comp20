Assignment: Lab #5

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

To my knowledge, all parts of the lab have been implemented correctly.
The lab reads in, parses, and prints the data correctly.

It is possible to request data from a different origin (such as 
http://messagehub.herokuapp.com/), but not from a local one. The same-origin 
policy restricts how a document or script from one origin can interact with 
one from another origin. Since the messagehub page is hoste on a web server,
it is the same origin, the lab program can interac with its information and
parse it. However, information on a local machine is not from the same 
origin, it cannot be displayed.
